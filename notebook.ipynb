    "Neural networks are often very successful at making predictions for inputs that are in some sense similar to the training data. However, if the training data is not sufficiently diverse, then at test time, one will often encounter inputs that are *out-of-distribution (OOD)* and for which the network might yield unpredictable and inaccurate results. In those cases, it would therefore be useful to have reliable estimates on the uncertainty of the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian neural networks are a standard way of tackling this problem. During training, instead of learning point estimates for the weights and biases of the network, one learns a probability distribution over those parameters. At test time, one first samples the network parameters from the learned distributions before making a prediction. As such, a Bayesian neural network represents a distribution of functions, which for a given input yields a certain distribution of outputs. \n",
    "However, it is not clear exactly how to specify the prior distribution on the weights, or how such a network generalizes on OOD data seems rather arbitrary.\n",
